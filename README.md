In this project, I became more comfortable with arrays, objects & loops. I learned how useful arrays can be in the form of storing the gameboard elements as an array. I also learned how objects make life easier by allowing us to refer back to them and their properties thus saving us a lot of time. Last, I started to understand how loops work and how great of a tool they are to use.
